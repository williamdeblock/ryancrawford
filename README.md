  <h1>Who is Ryan?</h1>
  <p>Ryan Crawford, also known as RYAN54321BOOM, is a 13 year old who spends his time playing guitar, making youtube videos, and playing video games. Ryan youtube channel “Crazy iMovies” is a channel that makes indie films, and sometimes talk shows. Some of his more popular youtube videos are his “I Hate” series, which is an original series complaining about different things, just like real life, And an indie film called “Howard The Zombie” Staring the famous actor, Eduardo Prisbe. The film is about a zombie that becomes friends with a human. One other thing on his youtube channel is guitar videos, but we’ll talk about those later. Some of the games Ryan plays are “Minecraft” and “Overwatch”. He also had a girlfriend at one point, but had a recent heart break once he found out his best friend, Eduardo Prisbe, was dating his girlfriend. Ever since, he’s lowered his standards to rock bottom and has searched xbox live to find his new girl friend, because god knows he has no chance with a girlfriend in real life.</p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO29pzSPKWgeIuvriksOIXA">His Youtube Channel</a> 

    
  <h1>Why Does he Suck?</h1>
  <p> Before we begin, heres a quick list on the things that are wrong with Ryan, </p>
  <ol>
  <li>Hes no help to the team in games where teamwork is key</li>
  <li>Things are never his fault</li>
  <li>Hes constantly switching sides whenever he benifits from it</li>
  <li>He never has a good responce to anything</li>
 
 <p>Starting from the top, he is no help to the team because hes to busy getting bronze in eliminations. The 3 characters he play don't help his case. He plays Torborn, a character who is no help to begin with, Solider, thinking he can 1v6 the enitire other team, and Lucio, who can be a help to the team, but hes not very good with lucio. In fact, Nate, a good friend of mine, beat ryan in a lucio 1v1, which brings me to my next point.</p>
