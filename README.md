  <h1>Who is Ryan?</h1>
  <p>Ryan Crawford, also known as RYAN54321BOOM, is a 13 year old who spends his time playing guitar, making youtube videos, and playing video games. Ryan youtube channel “Crazy iMovies” is a channel that makes indie films, and sometimes talk shows. Some of his more popular youtube videos are his “I Hate” series, which is an original series complaining about different things, just like real life, And an indie film called “Howard The Zombie” Staring the famous actor, Eduardo Prisbe. The film is about a zombie that becomes friends with a human. One other thing on his youtube channel is guitar videos, but we’ll talk about those later. Some of the games Ryan plays are “Minecraft” and “Overwatch”. He also had a girlfriend at one point, but had a recent heart break once he found out his best friend, Eduardo Prisbe, was dating his girlfriend. Ever since, he’s lowered his standards to rock bottom and has searched xbox live to find his new girl friend, because god knows he has no chance with a girlfriend in real life.</p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO29pzSPKWgeIuvriksOIXA">His Youtube Channel</a> 

    
  <h1>Why Does he Suck?</h1>
  <p> Before we begin, heres a quick list on the things that are wrong with Ryan, </p>
  <ol>
  <li>Hes no help to the team in games where teamwork is key.</li>
  <li>Things are never his fault.</li>
  <li>He never has a good response to anything.</li>
 
 <p>  Starting from the top, he is no help to the team because hes to busy getting bronze in eliminations. The 3 characters he play don't help his case. He plays Torborn, a character who is no help to begin with, Solider, thinking he can 1v6 the enitire other team, and Lucio, who can be a help to the team, but hes not very good with lucio. In fact, Nate, a good friend of mine, beat ryan in a lucio 1v1, which brings me to my next point.</p>
 <p>  My second point is Nothing is every Ryans fault, usually he has 5 excuses ready for when he loses, gets in an argument, or why he can't play good at the game. Most of the times his excuses consist of "My wifi isn't working",(which isn't a valid argument because if he can play minecraft just fine, he should be able to play overwatch,) "I don't feel like it," which is short for "I'm afraid I'm gonna lose," and so on. </p>
 <p>My third and final point is going to talk about how terrible his comebacks and responses are. They are just as bad as his social relevance, which is little to none because his only form of social media is Youtube due to the fact that his parents won't let him get things like instagram, snapchat, or twitter. But his excuse is "he doesn't want to get social media". Anyways, lets talk about his responces. They aren't very good ones, but he has some that'll make you say outloud "Is this kid stupid?" His answer would be that he has Strait A's in the school he joined during the last 5 weeks of school.</p>
 
<h1> Ryans "Amazing" Comebacks </h1>
<ul>
<li> Will = "Ryans, you are actually brain Dead" | Ryan = "At least I have strait A's" (Using grades as an excuse that you aren't stupid holds no weight because grades are easy to get and don't mean anything until highschool.)</li>
<li> Nate "Dude, you are terrible at Lucio" | Ryan = "I have more kills as him." (In Overwatch, Lucio is a support hero. Being a Support Hero means hes supposed to help the team by keeping them healed, but if your too busy going for kills as you let your team die, that makes you a terrible support hero and you should stick to DPS. Actually, since hes terrible at both DPS and Support, he should stick to playing Minecraft and let the Professionals play) </li>
